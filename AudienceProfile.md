# Sociodemographics
## Training & education
Linda Loring Nature Foundation(LLNF) has three hierarchical levels – Officers, Trustees and Lifetime Trustees. Officers include 4 persons – Daniel W. Drake as the current President, Greg McKechnie as the 1st Vice President, Duncan Macallister as the Treasurer and Rick Beaudette as the Clerk.(“Linda Loring Nature Foundation”, n.d.)  Its staff, including Kathryn K. Pochman, Sarah T. Bois and Seth I. Engelbourg, are mostly PhDs in the data science field and have contributed to the analysis of the nature land based on the results that they are pursuing. Moreover, LLNF also provides labs for educational purposes for the community in order to get more people connected to the nature. Therefore, it has a mature lab with comprehensive data for training and education. It opens most of its observation data to the public, seeking analysis from different perspectives from the community. 
## Technical skills
According to Susan T. Bois, LLNF has 8 sites in total and has certain plants with tags for observational purposes. It has portals for observers to send in observational data. The information will be stored on the public repository for more people to use. With the cooperation between LLNF and the community, there will be enormous sources of contribution to the data analysis of LLNF. 
## Data literacy
Data literacy means the ability to work with and understand data. (“Data Literacy,” n.d.) As we mention above, our stakeholders at LLNF are knowledgeable in the data science and research fields and therefore, the stakeholder group should be equipped with high data literacy.
# Goals (may include multiple specific topics, below)
## Organization values/mission
Linda Loring Nature Foundation is a non profit organization located at Nantucket. This organization got his values from **Linda Loring** who was an advocate and conservationist. Her objective to establish this foundation was to create a nature center at Nantucket.
The mission of **Linda loring & LLNF** is education, staff work to connect people of all ages and background to nature and plays a vital role in the community of Nantucket. This foundation mainly focused on three main areas of work: **Ecological Research, Environmental Education, and Land Stewardship**(“Linda Loring Nature Foundation”, n.d.). LLNF helps in preserving and protecting the biological environment of Nantucket which is very diverse.
 and also education people to respect the fragile habitates surrounding them.
## Expectations, benefits (as relate to project)
Linda Loring Nature Fundation has been established to preserve and protect the natural world on the Nantucket and educate people about how they can protect the surrounding fragile habitates.
There are many benefits from LLNF
* People Now aware about the fragile habitates and giving efforts to protect them.
* With the help of LLNF, Researchers can research on their property and can study about Shrubs, Herbs, Soil, Weather, Habitates and many more.
* LLNF helps in promoting the environmental literacy
* LLNF accomplished something very important in 2019 and awarded a $48,200 grant from the MassWildlife Habitat Management Grant Program  to create and improve grassland habitats removing invansive, non-native japanese black pine and trying to restore sandplain grasslands, sandplain heathlands and coastal shrublands which are native to nantucket("Awarded, Apr 2019 ").
## Needs (as relate to project)
* LLNF is trying to educate the communities about environment and habitates
* The LLNF has weekly bird and nature walks, summer kids programming, and adult education initiatives, they wants that communities should take interest in such programs ("Events at LLNF", Aug 2019)

# Communities/target markets (served by organization)

## Ability to act (on recommendations)
Since we will focus on the plants and the temperature data, LLNF’s ability to act will only be on the plants. With the analysis results on the temperature and plants, we would be able to help LLNF to predict the peak of breaking leaf buds and thus it is expected that LLNF will have a better vision of the growth trend of the plants and will manage the plants in a more effective way. 
## Challenges/competitors (may relate to needs)
Challenges that we identify for LLNF are as follows:
* LLNF has the plants tagged for observing and studying. However, LLNF has only some of the plants tagged for data collection, and it collects data on the plants once or twice a week on a regular basis. Therefore, it is possible that there is bias when we are performing data analysis.
* Temperature is a force majeure and thus we can do very little to deal with the temperature change. With the challenge.
