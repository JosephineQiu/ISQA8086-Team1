# Name (person & organization): Linda Loring Nature Foundation(LLNF)

# Sociodemographics
## Training & education
Linda Loring Nature Foundation(LLNF) has three hierarchical levels – Officers, Trustees and Lifetime Trustees. Officers include 4 persons – Daniel W. Drake as the current President, Greg McKechnie as the 1st Vice President, Duncan Macallister as the Treasurer and Rick Beaudette as the Clerk.(“Linda Loring Nature Foundation”, n.d.)  Its staff, including Kathryn K. Pochman, Sarah T. Bois and Seth I. Engelbourg, are mostly PhDs in the data science field and have contributed to the analysis of the nature land based on the results that they are pursuing. Moreover, LLNF also provides labs for educational purposes for the community in order to get more people connected to the nature. Therefore, it has a mature lab with comprehensive data for training and education. It opens most of its observation data to the public, seeking analysis from different perspectives from the community. 
## Technical skills
According to Susan T. Bois, LLNF has 8 sites in total and has certain plants with tags for observational purposes. It has portals for observers to send in observational data. The information will be stored on the public repository for more people to use. With the cooperation between LLNF and the community, there will be enormous sources of contribution to the data analysis of LLNF. 
## Data literacy
Data literacy means the ability to work with and understand data. (“Data Literacy,” n.d.) As we mention above, our stakeholders at LLNF are knowledgeable in the data science and research fields and therefore, the stakeholder group should be equipped with high data literacy.
# Goals (may include multiple specific topics, below)
## Business/organization values/mission
## Expectations, benefits (as relate to project)
## Needs (as relate to project)

# Communities/target markets (served by organization)
## Ability to act (on recommendations)
Since we will focus on the plants and the temperature data, LLNF’s ability to act will only be on the plants. With the analysis results on the temperature and plants, we would be able to help LLNF to predict the peak of breaking leaf buds and thus it is expected that LLNF will have a better vision of the growth trend of the plants and will manage the plants in a more effective way. 
## Challenges/competitors (may relate to needs)
Challenges that we identify for LLNF are as follows:
* LLNF has the plants tagged for observing and studying. However, LLNF has only some of the plants tagged for data collection, and it collects data on the plants once or twice a week on a regular basis. Therefore, it is possible that there is bias when we are performing data analysis.
* Temperature is a force majeure and thus we can do very little to deal with the temperature change. With the challenge.
