#### Work of Linda Loring Nature Foundation towards the effects of Temperature on Shrubs

Linda Loring Nature Foundation is doing a great job by taking care of multiple species and few of them are endangered too. Working towards there perseverance is present society’s responsibility and therefore our study will be a good contribution towards the cause. With changing temperatures and changing climate nowadays, flora and fauna are the real victims. As the whole development of a plant depends on the environmental factors of the location, one needs to keep an eye on these factors continuously. Mainly focusing on factors like temperature, and elevation, our report of analysis will help to understand the dependence of a plant on these factors. Cultivating a large area of land is not worth the efforts unless the quality of plants is not up to the standards and health and moreover, for this case, the ultimate goal is to have a good space full of healthy species of plants and things cannot be taken for granted. Timely recording of the required data for a long time is very helpful and therefore our study will be strong enough to help decision-makers with scheduling their plant growing process.  It is important to match the timings given the fact that productivity increases when the right plantation are done at the right time. Many organizations may be involved working towards something this but because every other species reacts to the change in a different manner, a collective study over varieties of species helps to predict development pattern possibility of plants that are not being studied. 

With one of the important research questions been focused on the study of temperature change pattern in early spring in Nantucket, people working towards the safe and well growth of all the species may find it important to make plans for every possible upcoming phase. For plants to be ready with the buds to burst at the right time of the spring (favorable), plantation must happen at the right time to match the whole timeline and therefore prediction is as equally important as taking care.

#### Presence of Caterpillars affects the process

Our study also includes caterpillars' data and information regarding their hatch cycle. As stated earlier, variation in temperature affects flora and fauna, caterpillars are also sensitive to the change. The study will help caretakers to learn about them and to be prepared. Caterpillars are harmful to the development of plants but they are one of the main factors in pollinating. Ongoing study will help understanding how the presence of Caterpillars affects the process of pollination if it does.

#### Take decision with the analysis result 

With one of the research question on which our study is based on is to find whether there exist a particular time when most of the shrubs break their leaf buds, to which the study will determine time and the data we have could be used by the decision-makers to understand all the factors affecting the development in the positive way and also the factors hindering the growth.

Soil temperature is another important part, and considering these records for the study will help planning irrigation systems too. generally, as the temperature of the soil affects the nutrient and water uptake of a plant (depending on the texture of the soil), therefore caretakers must have the idea to make sure that temperature remains maintained all time.

Also given as a fact that the increase in the air temperature does not guarantee increase in the soil temperature, recognizing the changing pattern of both individually and collectively may help caretakers bring changes to their style of maintenance.
As mentioned in the study that native shrubs like lowbush blackberry tracks early spring warmings and leaf out with warm temperatures and adapt but on the other hand plants like black huckleberry could not adapt to this change and are top killed during late frost, these studies help caretaker to save them by taking required measures if possible.

#### Report anomalies to Concerned official

With our report being studied by concerned officials of the organizations, they will be acknowledged regarding the anomalies data set comes with. Though some of them are un-evitable but having required knowledge is important because abled officials can upgrade resources if possible to help to collect clean data which in turn is helpful for both analyst team and people behind the Lora Loring Foundation. 
One of the research questions is to focus on understanding the role of elevation variation among 8 sites and their effect on the air temperature there at a particular elevation. Studying the same species and their growth at two different elevation can help understand how the factor of elevation affects the growth of each species. This will help to determine the importance of elevation factor favorable of different species. Or to trace the variations of recorded air temperature against elevation as every other location may possess different kinds of proportionality considering temperature and elevation together.
