Background research based on the phenology of Shrubs. Phenology is the study of the timing of the biological events in plants such as flowering, leafing, reproduction. Scientists who study phenology are interested in the timing of such biological events in relation to changes in season and climate("SouthernKangaroo",Sept 2019).

The non-profitable organization **Linda Loring Nature foundation (_LLNF_)** is doing some studies on 8 species of shrubs. The researchers from the organization study the biological events happen in shrubs (Prunus) and how temperature can affect their development, so they have maintained the Temperature logs. They have set up two Temperature loggers, one Temperature measures the air temperature on an hourly basis and 2nd Temperature logger buried under the soil to measure the soil temperature.

### What is Shrubs(Prunus) and how temperature affects their development

A shrub is a small- to medium-sized perennial woody plant. Shrubs have persistent woody stems above the ground. They are distinguished from trees by their multiple stems and shorter height, less than 6 m-10 m (20 ft–33 ft) tall.

Generally, plants grow faster with increasing air temperatures up to a point. Extreme heat will slow growth and also increase moisture loss. Generally, plants grow faster with increasing air temperatures up to a point. The temperatures for optimal growth vary with the type of plant. Some annual flowers and vegetables are extremely sensitive to cold, and transplants should not be planted until temperatures are consistently warm ("University of Illinois Extension" ,Aug 2019). Extremely hot or cold soil temperatures can also hamper plant growth, as well as affect seed germination. Cool temperatures in fall trigger the plant to reduce growth and store energy. As temperatures approach freezing, growth stops and the plant (if perennial) becomes dormant ("Doree Armstrong", May 2014). 

### Why Soil Temperature Matters 

Soil Temperature is very important for the roots of shrubs. We often just assume soil temperatures mirror the air temperature but they don't. There are different processes involved in how heat is moved. Example: Spring planting time is when soil temperatures are most critical. When do you put those seeds into the ground? That depends on what you’re planting. Different plants require various soil temperatures. And there’s more to consider once you’ve determined what you’re planting. For every type of plant, there is a minimum temperature for seeds to germinate and an optimum temperature for seed germination ("Dr. Ed Brotak", May 2019).

Since there is a difference between Soil and Air temperature that's why researchers have to take logs for both air and soil temperature.
To take the soil temperature we have to bury a temperature logger into the soil and monitor in some specific time intervals.

This type of Study mostly focuses on lifecycle events of shrubs like **First Bloom, Budburst (conifer), First leaf, First leaf, leaf elongation, End bloom.**

### About study on shrubs in Nantucket Island

There is an article [To Everything There Is a Season](https://yesterdaysisland.com/to-everything-there-is-a-season) which is about the study on Shrubs on Nantucket Island by **Dr. Sarah Treanor Bois**("Dr. Sara Bois",Sept 2019)
In this article, she mentioned some important points about springtime temperature on Nantucket Island.
Springtime temperatures have been arriving earlier on Nantucket, just like most of New England. There is year-to-year variation, but generally, they are seeing springtime temperatures arriving 2 to 4 days earlier than the historic average, So researchers are looking into it to find out that these changes in climate are affecting shrubs or not.

Dr. Bois's research at LLNF has shown that some of the native shrubs (lowbush blueberry, for example) can track the earlier spring warming and leaf out with the warm temperatures. However, just because they leaf out earlier, doesn’t mean they can just cruise into a longer growing season. Springs is also becoming more erratic with more frequent late frost events. Some of our species, like black huckleberry, have been topkilled during late frost events. If this type of effect becomes a pattern, could have devastating effects on the overall population. Other species, such as black cherry and beach plum, aren’t able to respond as nimbly to warming temperatures resulting in delayed phenology from surrounding species.
