# About Linda Loring Nature Foundation
## Brief Introduction and History
Back in 1957, with the purchase of the land between Eel Pointe Road and Madaket Road and finally managing to connect it to a 270-acre contiguous tract where it is a wildlife sanctuary, Linda Loring decided to keep the land and build a nature center in Nantucket. Founded in 1999 by Linda Loring as a 501(c)3 non-profit organization, Linda Loring Nature Foundation (LLNF) had only 5 acres of land back then. With the takeover by Kitty Pochman as the director of the organization, it has continuously grown into an organization with 108 acres of land nowadays.  (“Linda Loring Nature Foundation History,” n.d.)  After Linda Loring died in 2019, the foundation carries on her missions of connecting all ages and backgrounds to nature.
## Organization Goals and Missions
As stated on their website, “the Linda Loring Nature Foundation is dedicated to preserving and protecting Nantucket's biologically diverse ecosystems. The Foundation's property, a living laboratory for research and education, advances broad community support and environmental understanding to respect the fragile habitats surrounding us”. (“Linda Loring Nature Foundation Mission,” n.d.) LLNF has been striving to observe the growth of the species and sustain the diversity of the biological ecosystems. Therefore, the organization needs not only raise different species but also closely monitor and analyze the factors that could influence the growth of the species.  
In addition, LLNF also strives to enhance public understanding of the natural environment by serving as a *[living lab]( https://llnf.org/research)* for research and education. It enables people from different scientific fields to benefit from their resources. 
# Research Questions
## What We Are Interested In
We are interested in how climate change especially early Spring warming is affecting the shrub populations. There are 8 shrub species that we would like to study as they are the dominant species at LLNF. Among the 108 acres of land, 8 sites are defined for the study of the shrub. Each site has at least 3 individual plants tagged for our study as well as an hourly-based air temperature logger. The temperature of the soil is also recorded every 4 hours. The plants are observed once to twice every week in terms of breaking leaf buds, increasing leaf size and flowering. Here in this project, we will mainly focus on the influence of temperature on the breaking leaf buds, which happens in early Spring when the bud broke and the leaves are starting to grow after that suddenly. 
The datasets for all the species that we have right are from 2016 to Aug 2019. More data will be added as we go along. The datasets will be mainly from the public repository on the [Nature Notebook]( https://www.usanpn.org/natures_notebook) website and LLNF.

## Research Questions
Our research questions, based on the above-mentioned information about our project, are as follows:    
* What is the temperature change pattern in early Spring in Nantucket?      
* Is there a time in a year that the most shrubs break their leaf buds? If so, when is that?    
* How does the elevation variances among the 8 sites affect their temperature? Does the variance have a significant influence on the temperature? 
* How does air temperature affect the soil temperature? 
* Are the number of breaking buds functionally dependent on the air temperature and soil temperature? If yes, what will that be? 

## The Importance of the Research Questions
Our research questions will be beneficial in terms of the following aspects: 
* Prediction of temperature change - by discovering the pattern of temperature change we will be able to predict the temperature change in the future for the growth of all the species on the island. 
* Enhancement of our understanding of the growth patterns of different shrub species. By analyzing the breaking leaf buds we will hopefully establish a pattern of growth for the shrub species so that the staff members can be prepared to take further care of the shrubs in a certain time of a year. 
* Identifying the influence of elevation on temperature. By identifying the influence of elevation on temperature, we can differentiate the max/min temperature on each site and perform further analysis based on the elevation factor. 
* Identifying the influence of temperature on breaking buds. As it is known to all, global warming is a concerning issue to nature and the human being. With a specific function established between breaking buds and the other independent variables, we can provide a better prediction on the growth of the shrubs and contribute to maintaining the diversity of the plants on the island.   

# Study Organism/Phenomenon

Background research based on the phenology of Shrubs. Phenology is the study of the timing of the biological events in plants such as flowering, leafing, reproduction. Scientists who study phenology are interested in the timing of such biological events in relation to changes in season and climate("SouthernKangaroo",Sept 2019).

The non-profitable organization **Linda Loring Nature foundation (_LLNF_)** is doing some studies on 8 species of shrubs. The researchers from the organization study the biological events happen in shrubs (Prunus) and how temperature can affect their development, so they have maintained the Temperature logs. They have set up two Temperature loggers, one Temperature measures the air temperature on an hourly basis and 2nd Temperature logger buried under the soil to measure the soil temperature.

### What is Shrubs(Prunus) and how temperature affects their development

A shrub is a small- to medium-sized perennial woody plant. Shrubs have persistent woody stems above the ground. They are distinguished from trees by their multiple stems and shorter height, less than 6 m-10 m (20 ft–33 ft) tall.

Generally, plants grow faster with increasing air temperatures up to a point. Extreme heat will slow growth and also increase moisture loss. Generally, plants grow faster with increasing air temperatures up to a point. The temperatures for optimal growth vary with the type of plant. Some annual flowers and vegetables are extremely sensitive to cold, and transplants should not be planted until temperatures are consistently warm ("University of Illinois Extension" ,Aug 2019). Extremely hot or cold soil temperatures can also hamper plant growth, as well as affect seed germination. Cool temperatures in fall trigger the plant to reduce growth and store energy. As temperatures approach freezing, growth stops and the plant (if perennial) becomes dormant ("Doree Armstrong", May 2014). 

### Why Soil Temperature Matters 

Soil Temperature is very important for the roots of shrubs. We often just assume soil temperatures mirror the air temperature but they don't. There are different processes involved in how heat is moved. Example: Spring planting time is when soil temperatures are most critical. When do you put those seeds into the ground? That depends on what you’re planting. Different plants require various soil temperatures. And there’s more to consider once you’ve determined what you’re planting. For every type of plant, there is a minimum temperature for seeds to germinate and an optimum temperature for seed germination ("Dr. Ed Brotak", May 2019).

Since there is a difference between Soil and Air temperature that's why researchers have to take logs for both air and soil temperature.
To take the soil temperature we have to bury a temperature logger into the soil and monitor in some specific time intervals.

This type of Study mostly focuses on lifecycle events of shrubs like **First Bloom, Budburst (conifer), First leaf, First leaf, leaf elongation, End bloom.**

### About study on shrubs in Nantucket Island

There is an article [To Everything There Is a Season](https://yesterdaysisland.com/to-everything-there-is-a-season) which is about the study on Shrubs on Nantucket Island by **Dr. Sarah Treanor Bois**("Dr. Sara Bois",Sept 2019)
In this article, she mentioned some important points about springtime temperature on Nantucket Island.
Springtime temperatures have been arriving earlier on Nantucket, just like most of New England. There is year-to-year variation, but generally, they are seeing springtime temperatures arriving 2 to 4 days earlier than the historic average, So researchers are looking into it to find out that these changes in climate are affecting shrubs or not.

Dr. Bois's research at LLNF has shown that some of the native shrubs (lowbush blueberry, for example) can track the earlier spring warming and leaf out with the warm temperatures. However, just because they leaf out earlier, doesn’t mean they can just cruise into a longer growing season. Springs is also becoming more erratic with more frequent late frost events. Some of our species, like black huckleberry, have been topkilled during late frost events. If this type of effect becomes a pattern, could have devastating effects on the overall population. Other species, such as black cherry and beach plum, aren’t able to respond as nimbly to warming temperatures resulting in delayed phenology from surrounding species.

# Potential Benefits of the Analysis Results
## The kind of decisions, interventions, or actions that analysis results could support:

#### Work of Linda Loring Nature Foundation towards the effects of Temperature on Shrubs

Linda Loring Nature Foundation is doing a great job by taking care of multiple species and few of them are endangered too. Working towards there perseverance is present society’s responsibility and therefore our study will be a good contribution towards the cause. With changing temperatures and changing climate nowadays, flora and fauna are the real victims. As the whole development of a plant depends on the environmental factors of the location, one needs to keep an eye on these factors continuously. Mainly focusing on factors like temperature, and elevation, our report of analysis will help to understand the dependence of a plant on these factors. Cultivating a large area of land is not worth the efforts unless the quality of plants is not up to the standards and health and moreover, for this case, the ultimate goal is to have a good space full of healthy species of plants and things cannot be taken for granted. Timely recording of the required data for a long time is very helpful and therefore our study will be strong enough to help decision-makers with scheduling their plant growing process.  It is important to match the timings given the fact that productivity increases when the right plantation are done at the right time. Many organizations may be involved working towards something this but because every other species reacts to the change in a different manner, a collective study over varieties of species helps to predict development pattern possibility of plants that are not being studied. 

With one of the important research questions been focused on the study of temperature change pattern in early spring in Nantucket, people working towards the safe and well growth of all the species may find it important to make plans for every possible upcoming phase. For plants to be ready with the buds to burst at the right time of the spring (favorable), plantation must happen at the right time to match the whole timeline and therefore prediction is as equally important as taking care.

#### Presence of Caterpillars affects the process

Our study also includes caterpillars' data and information regarding their hatch cycle. As stated earlier, variation in temperature affects flora and fauna, caterpillars are also sensitive to the change. The study will help caretakers to learn about them and to be prepared. Caterpillars are harmful to the development of plants but they are one of the main factors in pollinating. Ongoing study will help understanding how the presence of Caterpillars affects the process of pollination if it does.

#### Take decision with the analysis result 

With one of the research question on which our study is based on is to find whether there exist a particular time when most of the shrubs break their leaf buds, to which the study will determine time and the data we have could be used by the decision-makers to understand all the factors affecting the development in the positive way and also the factors hindering the growth.

Soil temperature is another important part, and considering these records for the study will help planning irrigation systems too. generally, as the temperature of the soil affects the nutrient and water uptake of a plant (depending on the texture of the soil), therefore caretakers must have the idea to make sure that temperature remains maintained all time.

Also given as a fact that the increase in the air temperature does not guarantee increase in the soil temperature, recognizing the changing pattern of both individually and collectively may help caretakers bring changes to their style of maintenance.
As mentioned in the study that native shrubs like lowbush blackberry tracks early spring warmings and leaf out with warm temperatures and adapt but on the other hand plants like black huckleberry could not adapt to this change and are top killed during late frost, these studies help caretaker to save them by taking required measures if possible.

#### Report anomalies to Concerned official

With our report being studied by concerned officials of the organizations, they will be acknowledged regarding the anomalies data set comes with. Though some of them are un-evitable but having required knowledge is important because abled officials can upgrade resources if possible to help to collect clean data which in turn is helpful for both analyst team and people behind the Lora Loring Foundation. 
One of the research questions is to focus on understanding the role of elevation variation among 8 sites and their effect on the air temperature there at a particular elevation. Studying the same species and their growth at two different elevation can help understand how the factor of elevation affects the growth of each species. This will help to determine the importance of elevation factor favorable of different species. Or to trace the variations of recorded air temperature against elevation as every other location may possess different kinds of proportionality considering temperature and elevation together.
