# Study Organism/Phenomenon

This Background research based on phenology of Shrubs. Phenology is the study of the timing of the biological events in plants such as flowering, leafing, reproduction. Scientists who study phenology are interested in the timing of such biological events in relation to changes in season and climate.

The non-profitable organization **Linda Loring Nature foundation (_LLNF_)** is doing some studies on 8 species of shrubs. The researchers from the organisation study the biological events happen in shrubs (Prunus) and how temperature can affect their development, So they have maintained the Temperature logs. They have setup two Temperature loggers, one Temperature measures the air temperature on hourly basis and 2nd Temperature logger buried under the soil to measure the soil temperature.

#### What is Shrubs(Prunus) and how temperature affects their development

A shrub is a small- to medium-sized perennial woody plant. Shrubs have persistent woody stems above the ground. They are distinguished from trees by their multiple stems and shorter height, less than 6 m-10 m (20 ft–33 ft) tall.

Generally, plants grow faster with increasing air temperatures up to a point. Extreme heat will slow growth and also increase moisture loss. Extremely hot or cold soil temperatures can also hamper shrubs growth, as well as affect seed germination.
This type of Study mostly focuses on some shrubs lifecycle events like **First Bloom, Budburst (conifer), First leaf, First leaf, leaf elongation, End bloom.**

#### Some Species of Shrubs (Scientific Name)
* Prunus serotina
* Viburnum dentatum
* Corylus americana
* Prunus maritima
* Corylus americana
* Gaylussacia baccata
* Morella pensylvanica
* Quercus ilicifolia

#### About study on shrubs in Nantucket Island

Thers is nn article "**To Everything There Is a Season**" which is about the study on Shrubs on Nantucekt Island by **Dr. Sarah Treanor Bois**
In this article she mentioned some important points aboutSpringtime temperature on Nantucket Island.
Springtime temperatures have been arriving earlier on Nantucket, just like most of New England. There is year-to-year variation, but generally we are seeing springtime temperatures arriving 2 to 4 days earlier than the historic average. What does that mean for our plant species?
Her research at LLNF has shown that some of native shrubs (lowbush blueberry, for example) can track the earlier spring warming and leaf out with the warm temperatures. However, just because they leaf out earlier, doesn’t mean they can just cruise into a longer growing season. Springs is also becoming more erratic with more frequent late frost events. Some of our species, like black huckleberry, have been topkilled during late frost events. This is the type of affect which, if it becomes a pattern, could have devastating effects of the overall population. Other species, such as black cherry and beach plum, aren’t able to respond as nimbly to warming temperatures resulting in a delayed phenology from surrounding species.
