# About Linda Loring Nature Foundation
## Brief Introduction and History
Back in 1957, with the purchase of the land between Eel Pointe Road and Madaket Road and finally managing to connect it to an 270 acre contiguous tract where it is a wildlife sanctuary, Linda Loring decided to keep the land and build a nature center in Nantucket. Founded in 1999 by Linda Loring as a 501(c)3 non-profit organization, Linda Loring Nature Foundation (LLNF) had only 5 acres of land back then. With the takeover by Kitty Pochman as the director of the organization, it has continuously grown into an organization with 108 acres of land nowadays.  (“Linda Loring Nature Foundation History,” n.d.)  After Linda Loring died in 2019, the foundation carries on her missions of connecting all ages and backgrounds to nature.
## Organization Goals and Missions
As stated on their website, “the Linda Loring Nature Foundation is dedicated to preserving and protecting Nantucket's biologically diverse ecosystems. The Foundation's property, a living laboratory for research and education, advances broad community support and environmental understanding to respect the fragile habitats surrounding us”. (“Linda Loring Nature Foundation Mission,” n.d.) LLNF has been striving to observe the growth of the species and sustain the diversity of the biological ecosystems. Therefore, the organization needs not only raise different species but also closely monitor and analyse on the factors that could influence the growth of the species.  
In addition, LLNF also strives to enhance public understanding of the natural environment by serving as a *[living lab]( https://llnf.org/research)* for research and education. It enables people from different scientific fields to benefit from their resources. 
# Research Questions
##What We Are Interested In
We are interested in how climate change especially early Spring warming is affecting the shrub populations. There are totally 8 shrub species that we would like to study on as they are the dominant species at LLNF. Among the 108 acres of land, 8 sites are defined for the study of the shrub. Each site has at least 3 individual plants tagged for our study as well as an hourly-based air temperature logger. The temperature of the soil is also recorded every 4 hours. The plants are observed once to twice every week in terms of breaking leaf buds, increasing leaf size and flowering. Here in this project we will mainly focus on the influence of temperature on the breaking leaf buds, which happens in early Spring when the bud broke and the leaves are starting to grow after that suddenly. 
The datasets for all the species that we have right are from 2016 to Aug 2019. More data will be added as we go along. The datasets will be mainly from the public repository on the [Nature Notebook]( https://www.usanpn.org/natures_notebook) website and LLNF.

## Research Questions
Our research questions, based on the above-mentioned information about our project, are as follows:
•	What is the temperature change pattern in early Spring in Nantucket? 
•	Is there a time in a year that the most shrubs break their leaf buds? If so, when is that? 
•	How does the elevation variances among the 8 sites affect their temperature? Does the variance have a significant influence on the temperature? 
•	How does air temperature affect the soil temperature? 
•	Are the number of breaking buds functionally dependent on the air temperature and soil temperature? If yes, what will that be? 

## The Importance of the Research Questions
Our research questions will be beneficial in terms of the following aspects: 
•	Prediction of temperature change - by discovering the pattern of temperature change we will be able to predict the temperature change in the future for the growth of all the species on the island. 
•	Enhancement of our understanding on the growth patterns of different shrub species. By analysing on the breaking leaf buds we will hopefully establish a pattern of growth for the shrub species so that the staff members can be prepared to take further care of the shrubs in a certain time of a year. 
•	Identifying the influence of elevation on temperature. By identifying the influence of elevation on temperature, we can differentiate the max/min temperature on each site and perform further analysis based on the elevation factor. 
•	Identifying the influence of temperature on breaking buds. As is known to all, global warming is a concerning issue to the nature and the human being. With a specific function established between breaking buds and the other independent variables, we can provide a better prediction on the growth of the shrubs and contribute to maintaining the diversity of the plants on the island.
