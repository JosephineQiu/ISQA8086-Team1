 ## Updates made based on feedback
 
 ### Audience Profile : Josephine has updated the Audience Profile based on the feedback from the professor. She has updated the logo of "Linda loring nature foundation" S also updated the Information about Dr. Sarah bois.
 
 ### Rscript: Dhwani has updated the Rscript and added Timeseries to it. Also tried to seperate the Test from the Code as per the feedback from Professor.
 
 ### Rplot : Dhwani has updated the Rplot and added some more intresting variables so that it will be easy to interpret the data. Also we got some feedbacks from Classmates as Date Format is not correct and use some colors. So Dhwani added Timeseries because of that now Date Format is correct.
