## Linda Loring Nature Foundation(LLNF)

#### The Point of contact for this Project is Dr. Sarah T. Bois. She is Director of Research and Education at Linda Loring Nature Foundation,  Nantucket, Massachusetts. She has Doctor of Philosophy(Phd) in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology 

# Sociodemographics
## Training & education
Linda Loring Nature Foundation(LLNF) has three hierarchical levels – Officers, Trustees and Lifetime Trustees. Officers include 4 persons – Daniel W. Drake as the current President, Greg McKechnie as the 1st Vice President, Duncan Macallister as the Treasurer and Rick Beaudette as the Clerk.(“Linda Loring Nature Foundation”, n.d.)  Its staff, including Kathryn K. Pochman, Sarah T. Bois and Seth I. Engelbourg, are mostly PhDs in the data science field and have contributed to the analysis of the nature land based on the results that they are pursuing. Moreover, LLNF also provides labs for educational purposes for the community in order to get more people connected to the nature. Therefore, it has a mature lab with comprehensive data for training and education. It opens most of its observation data to the public, seeking analysis from different perspectives from the community. 

## Technical skills
According to Susan T. Bois, LLNF has 8 sites in total and has certain plants with tags for observational purposes. It has portals for observers to send in observational data. The information will be stored on the public repository for more people to use. With the cooperation between LLNF and the community, there will be enormous sources of contribution to the data analysis of LLNF.

## Data literacy
Data literacy means the ability to work with and understand data. (“Data Literacy,” n.d.) As we mention above, our stakeholders at LLNF are knowledgeable in the data science and research fields and therefore, the stakeholder group should be equipped with high data literacy.


# Goals of Organization
## Organization values/mission
Linda Loring Nature Foundation(LLNF) holdes the mission as it states on the website, “the Linda Loring Nature Foundation is dedicated to preserving and protecting Nantucket's biologically diverse ecosystems. The Foundation's property, a living laboratory for research and education, advances broad community support and environmental understanding to respect the fragile habitats surrounding us”. (“Linda Loring Nature Foundation Mission,” n.d.) LLNF has been striving to observe the growth of the species and sustain the diversity of the biological ecosystems. Therefore, the organization needs not only raise different species but also closely monitor and analyze the factors that could influence the growth of the species.  In addition, LLNF also strives to enhance public understanding of the natural environment by serving as a living lab for research and education. It enables people from different scientific fields to benefit from their resources.Linda Loring Nature Foundation is a non-profit organization located at Nantucket. This organization got his values from **Linda Loring** who was an advocate and conservationist. Her objective to establish this foundation was to create a nature centre at Nantucket.
The mission of **Linda Loring & LLNF** is education, staff work to connect people of all ages and background to nature and plays a vital role in the community of Nantucket. This foundation is mainly focused on three main areas of work: **Ecological Research, Environmental Education, and Land Stewardship**(“Linda Loring Nature Foundation”, n.d.). LLNF helps in preserving and protecting the biological environment of Nantucket which is very diverse.
 
## Expectations, benefits of LLNF Organization
Linda Loring Nature Foundation has been established to preserve and protect the natural world on the Nantucket and educate people about how they can protect the surrounding fragile habitats.
LLNF benefits in multiple ways:
* To spread awareness about the fragile habitats and making the community understand how important it is to give efforts in order to protect them.
* Researchers are provided with all the required sources to so as to develop different theories and to gain a proper understanding of shrubs, herbs, soil, weather, Habitats and many more.
* Promoting environmental literacy.

## Needs (as relate to project)
* LLNF aims to educate communities with environment and habitats.
* LLNF has weekly bird and nature walks, summer kids programming, and adult education initiatives,as they want communities to come forward and must develop interest towards such programs. ("Events at LLNF", Aug 2019)

# Communities/target markets (served by organization)

## Ability to act (on recommendations)
Since we will focus on the plants and the temperature data, LLNF’s ability to act will only be on the plants. With the analysis results on the temperature and plants, we would be able to help LLNF to predict the peak of breaking leaf buds and thus it is expected that LLNF will have a better vision of the growth trend of the plants and will manage the plants in a more effective way. 

## Challenges/competitors (may relate to needs)
Challenges that we identify for LLNF are as follows:
* LLNF has the plants tagged for observing and studying. However, LLNF has only some of the plants tagged for data collection, and it collects data on the plants once or twice a week on a regular basis. Therefore, there is a possibility that results tends to be biased with many exception as the result of analysis may mean nothing for some of the other species of plants.
* Temperature is a force majeure and thus we can do very little to deal with the temperature change. With the challenge.

## Organizational culture
LLNF holds very basic organizational structure with limited officers and thrive to involve more people from the society to contribute to the good cause. LLNF are very grateful to have many research partners by their side and believe in empowering the community together by supporting each other through research, education and stewardship. LLNF bring together people of all ages and background to educate them with summer programs, story walks, field trips, public talks, classroom discussions and through many other modes of sharing. (Linda Loring Nature Foundation Mission. (n.d.))

## Past achievements
* Linda Loring started with a piece of land in the year 1957 and visioned to conserve a big part of the isalnd for plants and wildlife sanctuary as she treasured. At present having major portion of Nantucket Island's land with 270 acres in total with proper care and furthur vision of protecting nature to its best.     (Linda Loring Nature Foundation Mission. (n.d.))
* linda loring's 270 acres of sandplain grassland of artistic's haven was in question when a hungury developer's team wanted to have it for millions of dollars to build ultra-wealthy compound for vacation with more than 100 homes. But Lina Loring had confidence to raise 14$ million needed by the deadline date to purchase development rights to the existing beautiful naturual property. Everything was in place and the foundation suceeded in protecting the land which may had lost is natural beauty from obvious man made pollution.          (Nantucket Today. (n.d.)) 
* Community Foundation's Nantucket Fund of $160,475 were granted to 22 island nonprofit agencies and LLNF's Transation Service of Nature Trail of was of them to be awarded.            (The Inquirer and Mirror. (2017, July 18))
* On April 4th of 2019 LLNF has been awarded with $48,200 in grant from the Mass Wildlife Habitat Management for their impressive work and to improve habitat.                        (The Inquirer and Mirror. (2019, April 6))

## Business model
"Businees model being a  design for successful operation of a business and specification describing how an organization fulfills its purpose", LLNF being a Non-profit Organization, its major source of revenue is contributions from different fund raisers and dividends. LLNF strive to acquire more land to direct surroundings to prosper and motives of conservation and therefore earns no profit using land as an asset. Notable expenses include charitable disbursements and compensation of officers.   (Rouse, M., Rouse, M., & Rouse, M. (n.d.))       (Tigas, M., Wei, S., Schwencke, K., & Glassford, A. (2013, May 9))

## Summary
The analysis that we conduct on the temperature and plants will benefit LLNF in terms of education and long-term management of the plants. By identifying the patterns of temperature changs and the corresponding influences of them on the phenophase of the plants, we hope that our audience will gain some ideas on their future strategies on plant management and planning.
