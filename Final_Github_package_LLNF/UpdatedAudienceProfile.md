Linda Loring Nature Foundation(LLNF) has three hierarchical levels – Officers, Trustees and Lifetime Trustees. Officers include 4 persons – Daniel W. Drake as the current President, Greg McKechnie as the 1st Vice President, Duncan Macallister as the Treasurer and Rick Beaudette as the Clerk.(“Linda Loring Nature Foundation”, n.d.)  Its staff, including Kathryn K. Pochman, Sarah T. Bois and Seth I. Engelbourg, are mostly PhDs in the data science field and have contributed to the analysis of the nature land based on the results that they are pursuing. Moreover, LLNF also provides labs for educational purposes for the community in order to get more people connected to the nature. Therefore, it has a mature lab with comprehensive data for training and education. It opens most of its observation data to the public, seeking analysis from different perspectives from the community. 

## Technical skills
According to Susan T. Bois, LLNF has 8 sites in total and has certain plants with tags for observational purposes. It has portals for observers to send in observational data. The information will be stored on the public repository for more people to use. With the cooperation between LLNF and the community, there will be enormous sources of contribution to the data analysis of LLNF.

## Data literacy
Data literacy means the ability to work with and understand data. (“Data Literacy,” n.d.) As we mention above, our stakeholders at LLNF are knowledgeable in the data science and research fields and therefore, the stakeholder group should be equipped with high data literacy.


# Goals of Organization
## Organization values/mission
Linda Loring Nature Foundation(LLNF) holdes the mission as it states on the website, “the Linda Loring Nature Foundation is dedicated to preserving and protecting Nantucket's biologically diverse ecosystems. The Foundation's property, a living laboratory for research and education, advances broad community support and environmental understanding to respect the fragile habitats surrounding us”. (“Linda Loring Nature Foundation Mission,” n.d.) LLNF has been striving to observe the growth of the species and sustain the diversity of the biological ecosystems. Therefore, the organization needs not only raise different species but also closely monitor and analyze the factors that could influence the growth of the species.  In addition, LLNF also strives to enhance public understanding of the natural environment by serving as a living lab for research and education. It enables people from different scientific fields to benefit from their resources.Linda Loring Nature Foundation is a non-profit organization located at Nantucket. This organization got his values from **Linda Loring** who was an advocate and conservationist. Her objective to establish this foundation was to create a nature centre at Nantucket.
The mission of **Linda Loring & LLNF** is education, staff work to connect people of all ages and background to nature and plays a vital role in the community of Nantucket. This foundation is mainly focused on three main areas of work: **Ecological Research, Environmental Education, and Land Stewardship**(“Linda Loring Nature Foundation”, n.d.).

LLNF benefits in multiple ways:

# Communities/target markets (served by organization)

## Ability to act (on recommendations)
Since we will focus on the plants and the temperature data, LLNF’s ability to act will only be on the plants. With the analysis results on the temperature and plants, we would be able to help LLNF to predict the peak of breaking leaf buds and thus it is expected that LLNF will have a better vision of the growth trend of the plants and will manage the plants in a more effective way. 

## Challenges/competitors (may relate to needs)
Challenges that we identify for LLNF are as follows:
* LLNF has the plants tagged for observing and studying. However, LLNF has only some of the plants tagged for data collection, and it collects data on the plants once or twice a week on a regular basis. Therefore, there is a possibility that results tends to be biased with many exception as the result of analysis may mean nothing for some of the other species of plants.
* Temperature is a force majeure and thus we can do very little to deal with the temperature change. With the challenge.

## Organizational culture
LLNF holds very basic organizational structure with limited officers and thrive to involve more people from the society to contribute to the good cause. LLNF are very grateful to have many research partners by their side and believe in empowering the community together by supporting each other through research, education and stewardship. LLNF bring together people of all ages and background to educate them with summer programs, story walks, field trips, public talks, classroom discussions and through many other modes of sharing. (Linda Loring Nature Foundation Mission. (n.d.))

## Business model
"Businees model being a  design for successful operation of a business and specification describing how an organization fulfills its purpose", LLNF being a Non-profit Organization, its major source of revenue is contributions from different fund raisers and dividends. LLNF strive to acquire more land to direct surroundings to prosper and motives of conservation and therefore earns no profit using land as an asset. Notable expenses include charitable disbursements and compensation of officers.   (Rouse, M., Rouse, M., & Rouse, M. (n.d.))       (Tigas, M., Wei, S., Schwencke, K., & Glassford, A. (2013, May 9))

## Summary
The analysis that we conduct on the temperature and plants will benefit LLNF in terms of education and long-term management of the plants. By identifying the patterns of temperature changs and the corresponding influences of them on the phenophase of the plants, we hope that our audience will gain some ideas on their future strategies on plant management and planning.
